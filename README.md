# TestDurableFunctionsPoc

A proof of concept to research the use of durable functions as a workflow mechanism.

The proof of concept:
- is built on .NET 3.1. 
- uses the Azurite emulator (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio )

To use the Azurite emulator with Docker, you will need to build the docker container with the following command: ```docker-compose up -d```.
